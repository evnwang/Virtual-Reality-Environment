1. Abstract

 This package is for creating binaural beat or monaural beat. You can play these beats in a simplified method. 
The rhythms or frequencys can be optionally selected and be tuned freely. You can choice your favorite brain 
waves. 

 The function of this package is inducing you to be extreme immersive mind state on the path to peak performance 
as a kind of "Brain-Wave Controller" which is generally known as biaural beat or monaural beat. You can handle 
your mind state by using this package which is able to control your brain waves by the binaural beat and the 
monaural beat.

2. For Immersion into Unity3D

 Immersion is one of the key factor to the successful to design virtual reality(VR) including Unity3D. The quality 
of VR depends on the immersion into VR which is a perception of being physically present in a non-physical world. 
The Immersive perception is generated by surrounding the user or the game player of the virtual environment presented 
images, sound or other stimuli.

 I design libraries and packages which enable VR system to produce or provoke the more direct effect. For instance, 
I developed a kind of "Brain-Wave Controller" which is generally known as "Biaural beat" or "Monaural beat" in a 
simplified method. The function of each library is inducing the user or the game player to be extreme immersive 
mind state on the path to peak performance. You can handle your mind state by using this library which is able to 
control your brain waves. By using my libraries and packages, the degree of immersion into your Unity products can 
increase relatively.


3. Setup and use-case

3.1. How to setup on editor

(1) Open a menu window named "Brain's Level Upper" on the window tab.

(2) Choose "Binaural Beat" or "Monaural Beat" in "Beat Type".

(3) Tune rhythms or frequencies to choice your favorite brain waves.

(3-1) If you want to tune rhythms, select from the following items.

- Gamma Rhythms(30-100 Hz): To be the peak concentration.
- Alpha Rhythms(8-12 Hz): To be relaxed state.
- Theta Rhythms(4-7 Hz): To be the meditative state and focusing the mind.
- Delta Rhythms(1-3 Hz): To have a good sleep.

(3-2) If you want to tune frequencies, regulate frequencies of Left and Right sided.

(3-3) Confirm whether the value of "Brain Waves(Hz)" is right.

(4) Regulate the sample Rate. This value depends on your device.

(5) Tune volumes. But it is recommended that the value is approximately 0.5.

(6) Assign the object in the Hierarchy View.

(6-1) If there is no object attached with "AudioListener" in the hierarchy view, 
      you can confirm that new game object is created.

(6-2) On the contrary, the component script of binaural or monaural beat attach 
      to existing object attached with "AudioListener" in the hierarchy view 
      to avoid overlapping of "AudioListener". The reason is that each scene 
      can only have one Audio Listener.

(7) Play (Ctrl + P) and listen for sounds of binaural or monaural beats.

(8) Build & Run (Ctrl + B) if there is no problem.


3.2. How to setup and use prefabs in this package

(1) Choice scene.

(2) Put prefab blow into Hierarchy view.

        AccelBrainBeat/BinauralBeatObject.prefab
    or 
        AccelBrainBeat/MonauralBeatObject.prefab

(3) Choose the following items in the Script Component attached to above prefab.

- Left Frequency (Hz)
- Right Frequency (Hz)
- Gain (like sound volumes)
- Sample Rate

(4) Play (Ctrl + P) and listen for sounds of binaural or monaural beats.

(5) Build & Run (Ctrl + B) if there is no problem.


3.3. How to reuse scripts in this package.

Summary is as follows:

        AccelBrain/Scripts/BinauralBeatController.cs
    or
        AccelBrain/Scripts/MonauralBeatController.cs

This script depends on Audio Component: "AudioListener".


(1) Declare the following namespaces.

    using UnityEngine;
    using AccelBrain;

(2) Declare the class which inherit MonoBehaviour.

(3) Instantiate class below.

        BinauralBeat brainBeat= new BinauralBeat();
    or
        MonauralBeat brainBeat= new MonauralBeat();

(4) Set the attributes of the left frequency.

    brainBeat.LeftFrequency = 400;

(5) Set the attributes of the right frequency.

    brainBeat.RightFrequency = 430;

(6) Set the attributes of the Gain. The default value is 0.5.

    brainBeat.Gain = 0.5;


(7) Set the attributes of the Sample Rate. The default value is 44100.

    brainBeat.SampleRate = 44100;


(8) Call the method.

    To play and listen for sounds:

        brainBeat.PlayBeat();

    to stop:
    
        brainBeat.StopBeat();


(9) Override the method: "OnAudioFilterRead" and call the method: "AudioFilterRead" in the object: "brainBeat".

    void OnAudioFilterRead(float[] data, int channels)
    {
        this._brainBeat.AudioFilterRead(data, channels);
    }


4. Concept of Binaural beat and Monaural beat

 According to a popular theory, brain waves such as Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma rhythms tend to be correlated 
with mind states. The delta waves(1-3 Hz) are regarded as the slowest brain waves that are typically produced during 
the deep stages of sleep. The theta waves(4-7 Hz) are offen induced by the meditative state or focusing the mind. 
The alpha waves(8-12 Hz) are associate with relaxed state. The beta waves(13-29 Hz) are normal waking consciousness. 
The Gamma waves(30-100 Hz) are the fastest of the brain waves and associated with peak concentration and the brain's 
optimal frequency for cognitive functioning.

 By a theory of the binaural beat, signals of two different frequencies from headphone or earphone are presented separately, 
one to each ear, your brain detects the phase variation between the frequencies and tries to reconcile that difference. 
The effect on the brain waves depends on the difference in frequencies of each tone. For example, if 400 Hz was played in 
one ear and 430 in the other, then the binaural beat would have a frequency of 30 Hz.

 The monaural beats are similar to the binaural beats. But they vary in distinct ways. The binaural beats seem to be "created" 
or perceived by cortical areas combining the two different frequencies. On the other hand, the monaural beats are due to direct 
stimulation of the basilar membrane. This makes it possible to hear the beats.

 Please choose either binaural beets or monaural beats. If you set up 5 Hz, your brain waves and the frequency can be tuned and 
then you are able to be the meditative state or focusing the mind. Or what you choose to be relaxed state is the alpha waves(8-12 Hz).
